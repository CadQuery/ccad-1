Example - Building Toy
======================

Suppose I want to generate a brick building toy for plastic injection
molding, similar to the one we know and love.  I'm looking for bricks
with the following unit configurations all the same height.

- 1 x 1
- 2 x 1
- 4 x 1
- 6 x 1
- 8 x 1
- 2 x 2
- 4 x 2
- 8 x 2
- 4 x 4

10mm is the brick height, and a unit brick will be 5mm by 5mm in x and
y.  I'll use ipython to develop and modify.  When I'm pleased with a
block of code, I'll place it in a file for future use.  I won't show
the ipython prompt.
